# Customer Purchase Prediction with Neural Networks

## Overview

This Google Colab project aims to predict whether a customer will make a repeat purchase from the company using neural networks. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze customer behavior and make informed predictions about their likelihood to make future purchases.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset used for training and testing the neural network is preprocessed to ensure it meets the model's requirements. This may involve balancing the dataset, standardization and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Neural Network Model:** The core of the project involves designing and training a neural network model. This model is configured to learn patterns from the provided data and make predictions based on customer features and historical purchase information.

3. **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a separate testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy is used to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting customer purchase behavior.

4. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new data. This information is valuable for the company to tailor marketing strategies and customer engagement efforts.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
2. Upload your dataset or use the sample dataset provided.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
4. Analyze the model's performance and predictions.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes common machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebook. You can install them using the following:

pip install tensorflow scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information, purchase history, and relevant features. Make sure your dataset is in a compatible format and includes the necessary information for training and testing the neural network.

## Future Improvements

This project can be extended and improved in several ways:

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Exploring different neural network architectures.
- Incorporating additional features for more accurate predictions.
- Conducting more in-depth analysis on customer segments.

Feel free to contribute and enhance the project further!
